# artibot_artimas_chatbot


## Step to run the project 

clone the repository using 

```
git clone https://github.com/pranav-kale-01/artibot_artimas_chatbot.git
```

To run the Django server on the local system use below command. (We tried deploying the django application but we are having some issues in python version support).

```
python manage.py runserver 8080  
```

Once deployed, you are ready to use the chatbot, simply send a post request to localhost:8080/artibot/
